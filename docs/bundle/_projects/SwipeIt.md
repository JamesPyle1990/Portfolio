This is a freelance project for a company called EJ3 games. Swipe it is a physical card game that I have adapted into an app. This was a very interesting and rewarding test of my object-oriented programming and problem-solving skills. The cards are not the traditional 1-10, 4 suit, 4 face card architecture. So, I truly had to make this game from scratch and learn the rules intimately to accurately portray the game.
