This is a rest api built with flask and python, I created in July 2021. It is a web framework connected to a no sql database called mongo using python and a dependency called flask. With this web framework the user can get and post names from a list on the cloud database.  

I believe this project is a good representation of my skills in algorithms and data structures. I am showing that I understand how a database backed rest api works. In a previous term we built a similar project using an entirely different web framework and database. I have enhanced the pervious artifact by creating a similar project with entirely different methods. 

  This project was particularly difficult because I had to download a new workspace and set it up to create this project. It was done in a virtual environment inside Python. I had to download and set up Python 3.9, Visual Code Studio IDE, flask, pymongo and the mongo atlas database. Once I got everything connected it was a bit easier from there. The biggest problem I faced was connecting the application to the database. I learned a lot about how these languages and frameworks work together because the set up process was so difficult. Although that frustration has led to a deeper understanding, so moving forward I’m actually glad I had the experience. 

Here is a link to the project! https://github.com/JamesPyle1990/JamesPyle1990.github.io/blob/master/CS-499%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures.zip
